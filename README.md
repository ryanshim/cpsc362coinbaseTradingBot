We are creating a bitcoin trading bot that analyzes historical prices and suggests buy/sell sentiment. It will be a desktop application that utilizes the Coinbase API to execute requests on historical data, which will then be analyzed to place buy or sell transactions. This bot will:
 
1. Link to your personal bitcoin account
2. View historical price data
3. View wallet contents (i.e. balance and history of transactions)
4. Convert currencies
5. Buy/Sell window for placing a transaction; automatic trading?
 
The application will display transaction and wallet information through a GUI created through the Tkinter module. It will also have selectable menus/options to navigate through the software.

###### Dependencies
* Python 3
* Coinbase Client
* Matplotlib
* SciPy & sklearn
